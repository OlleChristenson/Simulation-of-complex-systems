Main programs are DiseaseSimulation.m and P3_GammaBetaRatio.m

# An implementation of disease spreading which is based on a SIR-model. 

# Project formulation:
We will consider the three-compartment model known as SIR, where each individual is either Susceptible (S) to the disease, Infected (I), or has Recovered (R)
and is immune. Infected individuals infect the susceptible they meet with rate beta
and recover with rate gamma. In a simple ODE or PDE-version of the model only the
ratio k = beta/gamma matters for its behaviour of the model. In these exercises you will
examine what happens when we take into account spatial effects.
